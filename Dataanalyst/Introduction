  I am a Data Visualization Developer with over six years of hands-on experience in Business Intelligence (BI) and data analytics, specializing in Power BI and Tableau for building scalable, data-driven solutions that drive business and clinical decision-making. My technical expertise spans across end-to-end BI solution design — from data ingestion and transformation to visualization and performance optimization — with a strong focus on healthcare analytics, particularly within Home Health and Home Care domains using HomeCare HomeBase (HCHB) and OASIS datasets. I have led multiple projects where I collaborated with clinical and quality management teams to design enterprise-grade dashboards and analytical models that track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as patient outcomes, readmission rates, and quality compliance metrics, ensuring actionable insights are accessible to both operational and executive stakeholders. My background includes deep experience with Microsoft Azure Data Ecosystem, including Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Synapse (Data Warehouse), where I have implemented robust ETL pipelines to support large-scale clinical data processing. I bring a strong foundation in data modeling (star/snowflake schema design), DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and Power Query (M language) to design efficient semantic models in Power BI that align with enterprise data governance and reporting standards. In Tableau, I’ve developed advanced visualizations leveraging LOD (Level of Detail) calculations, parameterized dashboards, and data blending techniques to combine disparate clinical and operational datasets. My approach always emphasizes data accuracy, integrity, and reproducibility, ensuring compliance with healthcare data standards and internal quality frameworks. As part of cross-functional teams, I’ve played a Technical Product Owner role, translating complex business requirements into clear technical specifications, managing stakeholder expectations, and ensuring deliverables align with both business strategy and technical best practices. I regularly lead data discovery sessions, working closely with data engineering teams to profile, validate, and structure data for analytics, while ensuring that data management principles, metadata documentation, and version control are rigorously applied. My work extends to developing automated data pipelines and performance-optimized datasets that power self-service analytics and predictive modeling use cases. Beyond visualization, I have strong proficiency in SQL for ad hoc queries and advanced data manipulation, and I leverage Excel and Azure environments for rapid exploratory data analysis. I am passionate about integrating clinical domain expertise with data engineering and visualization frameworks to deliver insights that enhance patient outcomes and operational efficiency. My communication skills enable me to simplify complex analytical findings for non-technical stakeholders while maintaining technical precision when collaborating with engineering, security, and application development teams. Throughout my career, I’ve been driven by a commitment to data quality, scalability, and continuous improvement, employing agile methodologies and CI/CD principles in BI development to ensure iterative enhancement of reporting solutions. I also contribute to defining measurement methodologies and data collection standards that ensure consistent reporting across departments and systems. In essence, I bridge the gap between clinical intelligence and data technology, leveraging a blend of BI expertise, data engineering acumen, and healthcare analytics insight to enable data-driven decisions that ultimately improve care delivery and organizational performance.
