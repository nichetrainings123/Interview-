At Citi Bank, TX, during my tenure as a Senior Business Intelligence Analyst (Data Engineering Focused) from May 2023 to June 2024, I led multiple enterprise-scale initiatives aimed at modernizing financial and compliance analytics, streamlining legacy workflows, and ensuring enterprise-wide data governance through scalable, automated, and insight-driven BI solutions. My work was deeply anchored in the intersection of data engineering, analytics, and visualization, bridging technical implementation with strategic business value. I began by leading the migration of manual Excel-based reporting processes into Tableau and Power BI ecosystems, designing interactive dashboards that consolidated data from Azure SQL, on-premise SQL Server, and Oracle financial systems, delivering unified visibility into key financial metrics such as portfolio exposure, liquidity ratios, and compliance thresholds. I architected dimensional data models and optimized fact/dimension tables, enabling efficient drill-down analysis and cross-domain insights, while ensuring referential integrity and adherence to enterprise modeling standards. A significant portion of my contribution involved writing complex SQL stored procedures, CTEs, and window functions for data aggregation, cleansing, and validation, particularly around reconciliation between regulatory and financial datasets. I introduced a governed KPI framework that standardized metric definitions across finance, risk, and compliance functions, reducing metric inconsistencies and audit rework by over 30%. My Tableau dashboards incorporated parameter-driven interactivity, LOD (Level of Detail) expressions, and dynamic filters to allow stakeholders to pivot between views—comparing quarterly trends, credit exposures, and operational losses across business units in real time. Recognizing the need for consistency between visualization platforms, I implemented a dual-delivery architecture using both Tableau and Power BI, ensuring identical calculations and consistent visual narratives across platforms while enabling business users to consume insights in their preferred tools. Collaborating closely with data engineering teams, I facilitated the integration of Azure Data Factory pipelines, connecting disparate data lakes and warehouses into a centralized analytical layer. I also designed data validation logic and ETL checkpoints to capture data lineage, detect anomalies, and flag late or incomplete data feeds before dashboard refresh cycles. This proactive monitoring improved data accuracy and reduced failed refresh incidents by 40%. In my data governance role, I coordinated with information security and compliance teams to apply role-based access controls (RBAC) and data masking policies within both Tableau Server and Power BI Service, ensuring alignment with Citi’s enterprise data protection standards. I established Agile sprint cadences with product owners and engineering leads, managing backlog grooming, sprint planning, and iterative releases of dashboard enhancements through CI/CD deployment pipelines leveraging version control in Git. My collaboration extended beyond technical teams; I worked with risk, treasury, and regulatory reporting divisions to interpret business logic and translate it into precise technical requirements, facilitating clarity across multiple stakeholder groups. I frequently led root-cause analysis sessions, tracing data discrepancies through SQL profiling, log analysis, and metadata auditing, which directly improved data reliability and accelerated reconciliation processes. Additionally, I introduced data performance benchmarking scripts to test query efficiency and dashboard rendering times, identifying and resolving bottlenecks using query optimization and index tuning techniques. Beyond delivery, I focused on user enablement and adoption, conducting multiple training sessions and developing governance playbooks to standardize report publishing, parameter handling, and version control across Tableau developers and analysts. My dashboards became critical decision-support tools for executives, providing them with real-time portfolio risk metrics, trend analytics, and variance breakdowns essential for strategic planning and regulatory compliance. Throughout this project, I consistently championed a data-first mindset, ensuring all visual narratives were built upon accurate, trusted, and well-documented data. The result was a holistic BI ecosystem where operational transparency, analytical speed, and governance integrity converged — empowering Citi’s leadership to make confident, data-driven decisions.
