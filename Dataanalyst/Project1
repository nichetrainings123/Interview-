At Rio Tinto, as a Senior Business Intelligence Analyst, I led a large-scale Business Intelligence Modernization Project aimed at transforming the company’s fragmented analytics ecosystem into a unified, governed, and performance-optimized Power BI environment. The initiative was driven by the growing need for real-time, reliable insights across the company’s global production, quality, and finance domains. Before this modernization effort, the organization heavily relied on legacy Tableau dashboards, Excel spreadsheets, and manual data refresh processes. Different business units maintained their own KPIs, resulting in inconsistencies, redundancy, and delays in reporting cycles. Executives often faced challenges in aligning reports across departments, and the lack of centralized data governance created compliance and auditability gaps. The project’s primary objective was to design a centralized BI architecture that would standardize KPIs, enhance data quality, enforce security, and empower users with self-service analytics capabilities.

My first major responsibility involved migrating Tableau dashboards to Power BI. This was not a simple report conversion task—it required re-engineering the data model and creating a scalable semantic layer in Power BI that would serve as a single version of truth for all reporting. I started by collaborating closely with engineering, finance, and quality teams to understand their visualization requirements, pain points, and performance bottlenecks. Once these requirements were gathered, I designed enterprise-grade Power BI dashboards that showcased production yield, quality deviation, financial performance, and operational efficiency. These dashboards utilized advanced DAX formulas, custom visuals, and time intelligence measures to deliver deeper insights. For example, I implemented dynamic KPI cards and drill-down functionalities, allowing executives to move seamlessly from a high-level overview to granular, department-level metrics.

To ensure optimal performance and data accuracy, I focused on data modeling best practices. I implemented star and snowflake schema designs to improve query execution and data relationships, which significantly enhanced the efficiency of aggregations and drill-down analysis. I also introduced incremental data refresh and optimized DAX queries using the Performance Analyzer tool in Power BI, which reduced dashboard refresh times by nearly 65%. These optimizations ensured that reports loaded in seconds instead of minutes, which had a direct impact on user adoption and satisfaction.

Another major milestone was establishing a Power BI semantic layer and governed workspaces. I designed reusable datasets that allowed multiple dashboards to consume consistent data models and measures. This eliminated redundancy and enforced data consistency across different business functions. I collaborated with data engineers and IT governance teams to integrate Power BI with the existing SQL Server and Azure Data Lake environment, ensuring automated and secure data pipelines. The Power BI Gateway was configured for scheduled refreshes, eliminating manual updates and ensuring that users always had access to the latest data.

Data governance and compliance were also central to this initiative. Given the sensitivity of operational and financial data, I implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) and sensitivity labels to restrict data access based on user roles and organizational hierarchy. I worked closely with IT and compliance teams to design a data quality validation framework, which included SQL-based anomaly checks and Power Automate alerts to detect and flag inconsistencies in near real time. Additionally, I developed comprehensive data lineage maps and a data dictionary that documented data flows, transformations, and ownership across the BI landscape. These governance assets became a cornerstone for audit readiness and transparency, especially during internal compliance reviews.

To address the problem of inconsistent and duplicated KPIs across departments, I initiated the creation of a KPI standardization framework. This involved collaborating with business stakeholders from production, finance, and quality functions to define standardized formulas, data sources, owners, and refresh cadences for every critical metric. I then implemented a centralized KPI repository within Power BI Service, ensuring that all dashboards pulled metrics from the same verified source. This governance-driven approach improved KPI alignment and reduced redundant dashboard requests by 30%, freeing analysts to focus more on insights rather than maintenance.

Throughout the project, I maintained a strong focus on cross-functional collaboration. I partnered with operations and quality leads to validate metric accuracy and ensure that definitions matched operational realities on the ground. I also worked with the finance team to ensure that cost and budget reports adhered to internal and external audit requirements. Beyond the technical implementation, I played a key role in the Agile delivery process, contributing to sprint planning, backlog refinement, and story estimation. Each sprint concluded with demo sessions to business stakeholders, where I presented new dashboard features and gathered feedback for iterative improvements.

Another critical aspect of my work was user enablement and self-service BI. I conducted multiple Power BI training workshops for analysts and business users to help them navigate dashboards, create ad-hoc reports, and interpret KPI trends. To promote self-sufficiency, I prepared detailed documentation and quick-start guides covering data sources, model logic, and visualization best practices. These resources empowered non-technical users to perform their own analysis confidently, reducing dependency on the central BI team.

The impact of this project was substantial. By consolidating disparate data systems into a governed Power BI environment, Rio Tinto achieved enterprise-wide data consistency and real-time visibility into key performance metrics. Report refresh and maintenance times were reduced by 65%, ensuring faster decision-making. The KPI standardization framework improved metric traceability and cross-functional alignment, while the introduction of RLS and compliance frameworks strengthened data privacy. The new governance documentation provided the organization with a solid foundation for audits and process transparency.

Overall, this project not only transformed Rio Tinto’s reporting infrastructure but also elevated the company’s analytics maturity. It demonstrated the strategic value of modern BI tools when combined with sound data governance and cross-departmental collaboration. More importantly, it bridged the gap between technology and business — providing decision-makers with clean, reliable, and actionable insights that drove operational efficiency, cost optimization, and data-driven culture across the organization.

In summary, my role at Rio Tinto went beyond building dashboards—I architected a complete Power BI ecosystem that streamlined reporting, enhanced data governance, and delivered measurable business impact. This experience not only deepened my technical expertise in Power BI, DAX, and data modeling but also strengthened my ability to align analytical solutions with strategic business goals, making it one of the most impactful projects of my career.
