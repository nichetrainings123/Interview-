⚙️ 2. RHEL Boot Process (Step-by-Step)

The boot process describes what happens when a RHEL system powers on until it’s ready for use.

🪜 Step 1: BIOS / UEFI Initialization

Performs POST (Power-On Self-Test) — checks hardware (CPU, RAM, disk).

Searches for bootable device based on boot order.

Loads boot loader (like GRUB2) into memory.

🪜 Step 2: Boot Loader (GRUB2)

GRUB2 (GRand Unified Bootloader) loads the Linux kernel.

Displays boot menu (/boot/grub2/grub.cfg).

Passes kernel parameters to the Linux kernel.

Commands related to GRUB:

grub2-editenv list
cat /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

🪜 Step 3: Kernel Initialization

Kernel (vmlinuz) is loaded into memory.

Initializes hardware drivers.

Mounts initial RAM disk (initramfs).

Prepares root filesystem.

Check kernel version:

uname -r

🪜 Step 4: systemd Initialization

Once kernel starts, it launches PID 1 → systemd.

systemd reads default target (boot mode).

Starts essential services (network, logging, display, etc.).

Check current target:

systemctl get-default


Change target (e.g., CLI mode):

systemctl set-default multi-user.target

🪜 Step 5: User Space Initialization

System reaches login prompt (CLI or GUI).

Background daemons like sshd, crond, NetworkManager start.

User can log in via console or SSH.

✅ Summary of Boot Process
Stage	Component	Description
1	BIOS/UEFI	Hardware check and boot loader initiation
2	GRUB2	Loads kernel and initramfs
3	Kernel	Hardware detection, root FS mounting
4	systemd	Initializes targets, starts services
5	User Space	Login prompt, shells, and daemons
📁 3. Linux Directory Structure (Filesystem Hierarchy)

RHEL follows FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) for organizing files and directories.

🗂️ Root Directory /

Everything in Linux starts from / — the root of the filesystem tree.

Directory	Purpose / Description
/boot	Bootloader files, kernel images (vmlinuz, initramfs)
/bin	Essential user commands (ls, cp, mv)
/sbin	System binaries (administrative commands)
/etc	Configuration files for system and services
/home	User home directories
/root	Home directory for the root user
/usr	User programs, libraries (/usr/bin, /usr/lib)
/var	Variable data (logs, mail, spool, cache)
/tmp	Temporary files
/dev	Device files (disks, terminals)
/proc	Kernel and process information (virtual FS)
/sys	System information (hardware and drivers)
/run	Runtime process data
/mnt	Temporary mount point for external storage
/media	Mount point for removable devices (CD, USB)
/opt	Optional or third-party software packages
🧾 Example Commands
df -h          # View disk usage by mount point
lsblk          # List block devices
du -sh /var/*  # Check directory size
mount          # List mounted filesystems

🧰 4. Important Operational Commands in RHEL

Below are must-know operational commands categorized for easy memorization:

🧭 A. Navigation & File Management
pwd                      # Print working directory
cd /path/to/dir          # Change directory
ls -l /etc               # List contents with details
cp file1 file2           # Copy file
mv file1 dir/            # Move or rename
rm -rf folder/           # Delete directory
mkdir newdir             # Create directory
touch file.txt           # Create new empty file

🧾 B. File Viewing & Editing
cat file.txt             # Display entire file
less file.txt            # Page-by-page view
head -n 10 file.txt      # Show first 10 lines
tail -f /var/log/messages # Live log monitoring
nano file.txt            # Edit using Nano
vim file.txt             # Edit using Vim

👤 C. User & Group Management
useradd john
passwd john
usermod -aG wheel john   # Add user to sudoers group
groupadd developers
chown john:developers file.txt
chmod 755 script.sh
whoami                   # Current user
id                       # UID, GID info

⚙️ D. System & Process Management
ps aux                   # Show all processes
top                      # Real-time system monitor
kill -9 <PID>            # Force terminate process
systemctl start httpd    # Start service
systemctl status sshd    # Check service status
systemctl enable nginx   # Auto start at boot
